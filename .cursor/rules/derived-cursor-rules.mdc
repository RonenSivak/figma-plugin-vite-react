## HEADERS

## TECH STACK

## PROJECT DOCUMENTATION & CONTEXT SYSTEM

## CODING STANDARDS

## WORKFLOW & RELEASE RULES

When modifying the `package.json` file, use `npm-run-all` if it is already a `devDependency` to run multiple scripts. This is preferred for build commands.

## DEBUGGING

Fastest way to look where test gets stuck when it is not obvious from output is to disable headless mode and enabled slowMo in `playwright.config.ts` file and rerun specific test.
