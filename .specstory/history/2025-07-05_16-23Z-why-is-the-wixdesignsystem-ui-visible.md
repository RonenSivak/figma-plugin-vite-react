_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user is asking about why they can see the UI of the WixDesignSystem. Looking at the attached file, I can see they're using `WixDesignSystemProvider` with `features={{ newColorsBranding: true }}`. Let me investigate this to understand what's happening.

The user wants to understand why they can see the Wix Design System UI. This could mean:
1. They're surprised they can see it when they shouldn't be able to
2. They're wondering how it's working/appearing
3. They might be having an issue with visibility

Let me check the project structure and understand how the Wix Design System is being used here. I should look at:
1. The main.tsx file (which I can see)
2. The App.tsx file to see how it's being used
3. The package.json to see what dependencies are installed
4. Any styling that might be related

I should investigate to understand the current state and why the Wix Design System UI is visible.</details></think>

I'll investigate why you can see the WixDesignSystem UI by examining the current setup and dependencies.

---

Read file: package.json

---

Read file: src/ui/App.tsx

---

Read file: src/ui/styles/App.css

---

Read file: src/ui/styles/index.css

---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Now I can see what's happening. Looking at the files:

1. In `package.json`, they have both `@wix/design-system` version `^1.204.0` and `wix-style-react` version `^10.173.2` as dependencies.

2. In `main.tsx`, they're using `WixDesignSystemProvider` with the `newColorsBranding` feature flag.

3. In `App.tsx`, they're using multiple Wix Design System components like `Box`, `Card`, `Button`, `Text`, and `Tag`.

4. The CSS files (`App.css` and `index.css`) are mostly commented out, so they're not interfering with the Wix Design System styles.

The reason they can see the WixDesignSystem UI is because:

1. **It's properly installed**: The `@wix/design-system` package is installed as a dependency.

2. **It's properly configured**: The `WixDesignSystemProvider` is wrapping the entire app with the `newColorsBranding` feature enabled, which provides the design system context.

3. **Components are being used**: The `App.tsx` file is actively using Wix Design System components like `Box`, `Card`, `Button`, etc.

4. **Styles are loading**: The design system's CSS is being loaded automatically when the components are imported and used.

5. **No conflicting styles**: The default CSS is commented out, so it's not interfering with the design system styles.

So the answer is that they can see the WixDesignSystem UI because everything is properly set up and working as expected. The design system is providing the visual styling and components that are rendering in the UI.</details></think>

You can see the WixDesignSystem UI because it's properly installed and configured in your project. Here's why it's working:

## **Dependencies Are Installed**
Your `package.json` shows:
```json
"@wix/design-system": "^1.204.0",
"wix-style-react": "^10.173.2"
```

## **Provider Is Configured**
In `main.tsx`, you're wrapping your app with `WixDesignSystemProvider`:
```tsx
<WixDesignSystemProvider features={{ newColorsBranding: true }}>
  <App />
</WixDesignSystemProvider>
```

## **Components Are Being Used**
Your `App.tsx` is actively using Wix Design System components:
- `Box` - for layout and spacing
- `Card` - for the main container
- `Button` - for interactive elements
- `Text` - for typography
- `Tag` - for the response display

## **Styles Are Loading Automatically**
The Wix Design System automatically loads its CSS when components are imported and used. Your custom CSS files (`App.css` and `index.css`) are commented out, so they're not interfering with the design system styles.

## **Everything Is Working As Expected**
The design system is providing:
- **Visual styling** (colors, fonts, spacing)
- **Component behavior** (hover states, interactions)
- **Responsive design**
- **Accessibility features**

Your UI is displaying the Wix Design System because it's properly integrated and functioning correctly. The components like `Box`, `Card`, and `Button` are rendering with their intended Wix design system styling and behavior.
